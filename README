Steps to get the BIGIP up and running with the pools, virtual servers and security policy attached to the virtual server:

In the TMSH, type following commands:

$ bash
$ touch /var/config/rest/iapps/enable

this enables the iControl LX under iApps ("package management LX")

next navigate to the F5 github and locate the latest .rpm file for AS3

https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-appsvcs-extension/tree/master/dist/latest

download and save the .rpm locally

Navigate to iApps->Package Management LX and click import...

find the .rpm file and click upload

Now that we have completed the steps above, we are ready to send a POST to the API endpiont /mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare with our JSON

In Postman (or any other API tool) send a POST to the endpoint "https://<big_ip>/mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare" 
Grab the .json file from the Github repo (and edit as necessary for your environment) 
Grab the .xml security policy and save where you would prefer (and edit the .json file as necessary)--remember, you can create your own security policy, and export as an XML and reference that in your .json to use the specific security policy with your VS
send the request and ensure you recieve a 200 OK status

In the BIGIP Gui , navigate to the correct partition and all the changes should be successfully seen.
